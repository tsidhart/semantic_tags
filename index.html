        <font face="Verdana" color="Orange">Narayana Guru</font>, also known as Sree Narayana Guru (c. 1856 - 20 September 1928),
        was a social reformer of India. He was born into a Kerala family in an era when people from
        such communities, which were regarded as Avarna, faced much social injustice in the
        caste-ridden of Kerala.

        <p title="Sree Narayana Guru">He led a reform movement in Kerala, rejected casteism, and promoted new values of spiritual
        freedom and social equality. He stressed the need for the spiritual and social uplift of
        the downtrodden by their own efforts through the establishment of temples and educational
        institutions. In the process, he denounced the superstitions that clouded the fundamental
        Hindu cultural convention of caste.
