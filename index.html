    <p>
       Narayana Guru, also known as Sree Narayana Guru (c. 1856 - 20 September 1928),
       was a social reformer of India. He was born into a Kerala family in an era when people from
       such communities, which were regarded as Avarna, faced much social injustice in the
       caste-ridden of Kerala.

       He led a reform movement in Kerala, rejected casteism, and promoted new values of spiritual
       freedom and social equality.[1] He stressed the need for the spiritual and social uplift of
       the downtrodden by their own efforts through the establishment of temples and educational
       institutions. In the process, he denounced the superstitions that clouded the fundamental
       Hindu cultural convention of caste.
